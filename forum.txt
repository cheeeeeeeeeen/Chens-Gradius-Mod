Hello. I decided to share my mod here in the forums. I'm not very good at documenting, but it will improve as time passes. Without further ado...

[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/FKqzjlB.png[/IMG]
[B][U][SIZE=6]Mod Version: 1.0.3
tModLoader: 0.11.6.2[/SIZE][/U][/B]

I have always been a fan of the classic side-scrollers, so I made a mod related to it. On top of that, I want to learn C# as well.
This mod's content will focus in implementing features that came from classic side-scrollers such as Gradius, R-Type and more.
The mod will also focus to be [B][U]playable on multiplayer[/U][/B], so please file in a bug if there is a desync issue that is detected.

This mod is on the Mod Browser, so download it from there.
If the Mod Browser is down, then you can refer to this link to download the latest release: [URL='https://github.com/cheeeeeeeeeen/Chens-Gradius-Mod/releases']Gradius Mod Releases[/URL]

[B][URL='https://github.com/cheeeeeeeeeen/Chens-Gradius-Mod/wiki'][SIZE=5]Chen's Gradius Mod Wiki[/SIZE][/URL][SIZE=5] is a place where you can find detailed information about the added features the mod provides.[/SIZE][/B]

[IMG]https://i.imgur.com/eMljrLn.png[/IMG]

All enemies in this mod also display a behavior of retaliation as commonly seen in the Gradius series if the world is in Expert mode.
Retaliation behavior is an enemy trait where the enemy shoots hostile bullets upon taking damage. Currently, there are three kinds of behaviors implemented: Spray, Spread and Explode.
Spray pattern is a single inaccurate bullet spawned towards the player. They are often faster than the normal attacks of the enemies.
Spread pattern is a group of bullets fired in a single shot. All of the bullets have the same speed, only their directions differ.
Explode pattern is a group of bullets fired in all directions in a single shot. There is room for evasion here compared to Spread pattern, and are often slower.

[B][U][SIZE=6]Option Compatibility[/SIZE][/U][/B]
Due to the [I]Highlighted Issue[/I] above, it is highly unlikely that we will support all the mods existing. The more appropriate description for the task is it being impossible to complete.
If you want [U]your own mod's projectiles to be compatible with the Options[/U], then take these items below in mind when implementing your projectile:
[LIST]
[*]Make sure the projectile is [B]active[/B]. ([I]projectile.active[/I] is true)
[*]Make sure that your projectile is [B]not a Yo-yo[/B].
[*]Make sure the projectile [B]is not hostile[/B]. ([I]projectile.hostile[/I] is false)
[*]Make sure the projectile [B]is friendly[/B]. ([I]projectile.friendly[/I] is true)
[*]Make sure the projectile [B]is not an NPC projectile[/B]. ([I]projectile.npcProj[/I] is false)
[*]Make sure the projectile [B]has damage[/B].
[*]Make sure the projectile [B]can deal critical damage[/B]. (Melee, Ranged, Thrown and Magic)
[*]Make sure the projectile [B]is not a minion[/B]. ([I]projectile.minion[/I] is false)
[*]Make sure the projectile [B]is not a trap[/B]. ([I]projectile.trap[/I] is false)
[*]Make sure the projectile [B]is owned by the same player who generated the projectile[/B].
[/LIST]

If their modded projectiles have an advanced AI or feature and they are duplicating a lot of projectiles which causes lag with the Options,
then this mod [U]offers an API for other mod creators through Mod.Call[/U]. Head on over to [I]API[/I] Section just below for more details.
